    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"datacube\" is a digital information architecture that specialises in hosting and cataloguing spatial information. Eo2cube is based on the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) infrastructure and specialises in storing remotely sensed data, particularly from Earth Observation satellites such as Landsat and Sentinel-2. The eo2cube contains multiple analyse ready satellite data \"products\". These data products are often composed of a range of \"measurements\" such as the suite of remote sensing band values. This notebook will focus on several straightforward ways to inspect the product,  measurement of a datacube, as well as to run data query and loading the data using a wide range of options, including resampling and interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to **browse the available products/ measurements** stored within, and how to **load data** from the eo2cube datacube by using the `dc.load()` function. Topics covered include:\n",
